So, after many rounds of acrimonious jousts :wrestling: with the ever-demanding SigBovik reviewer committee :guardsman: with their triple-blind review antics (http://sigbovik.org/2021/), this soon-to-be-cult-classic got accepted :innocent:!
In order to pay lip-service to the reproducibility-goons :speak_no_evil: (it was either this or extortion money :money_with_wings:), I decided to _‚Äùvoluntarily‚Äù_üëÄ open source the data and the research materials :test_tube: :satellite: that went into the paper :roll_of_paper: :page_with_curl:.
